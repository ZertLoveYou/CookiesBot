# HOW TO INSTALL THIS STUPIDASS BOT
> a.k.a. CookiesBot, the only Discord bot that floats in the clouds ‚òÅÔ∏èüí§
---
## Step 1: Clone this stupidass piece of shits
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZertLoveYou/CookiesBot.git
```

## Step 2: Install the stuff your computer should‚Äôve already had
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 3: Watch it scream, then fill the damn `config.json`
Just run it once, it‚Äôll cry about missing config:
```bash
python main.py
```
It'll generate `data/config.json` and then die. Your job? Fill it.
```json
{
  "TOKEN": "your token",
  "PREFIX": "your prefix",
  "CLIENT_ID": "your bot client id ",
  "BOT_NAME": "your bot name"
}
```

## Step 4: Actually run the bot now
```bash
python main.py
```

### REMEMBER:
- Your logs live in the logs/ folder. Check them before crying.
- If the bot isn‚Äôt working:
  1. You probably didn‚Äôt fill the config.json.
  2. Read #1 again.
  3. Don't DM me saying ‚Äúbro bot not work‚Äù.
